Exoplanet Exploration

#### Here are the list of modes tried and their scores:

Logistic Regression scored 60.98%		(V1)
Linear Model  scored 56.08%			(V2)
Decision Tree Classifier scored 86.49%		(V2)
Random Forest Classifier 89.30%			(V2)
KNN Classifier scored 81%			(V3)
SVM tried with rbf kernel scored 82.72%		(V4)
(Tried with different kernel and MinMaxScaler and Standard Scaler)

Deep neural network architecture model 
ends with 89.59% and loss rate is 32.97%    	(V5)


Out of these Deep learning model and Random Forest Classifier scored above 85%.
So I want to take these two models and try to tune further and got these results:

Random Forest Classifier scored 89.53%		(v7)
and
Deep Learning model got 89.93% 			(V6)

Finally deep learning model ends up with 89.93% and loss rate is 26.69%
